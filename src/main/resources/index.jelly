  A library wrapped into a Jenkins plugin to read static analysis reports into a Java object model.
  This Java object model can read, aggregate, filter, and query static analysis reports. 
  It is used by Jenkins' warnings plug-in to visualize the warnings of individual builds. 
  Additionally, this library is used by Jenkins' autograding plugin to grade student software projects 
  based on a given set of metrics (unit tests, code and mutation coverage, static analysis warnings).
